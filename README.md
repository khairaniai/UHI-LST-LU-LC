<h1>Urban Heat Island, Land Surface Temperature, and Land Use/Land Change using Landsat Data</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project investigates the relationship between land cover changes in 2014 and 2021 with Land Surface Temperature (LST) in the same years to identify Urban Heat Island (UHI) impacted areas in DKI Jakarta in 2014 and 2021. The land cover processing method used is unsupervised classification, utilizing Landsat 8 Level 2 imagery. The analysis results indicate a significant change in land cover by 2021, leading to more organized residential areas, which caused lower LST in 2021 compared to 2014, thereby reducing the UHI-affected areas in 2021.
